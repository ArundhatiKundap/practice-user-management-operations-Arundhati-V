File has SQL queries for INSERT ,UPDATE ,DELETE and Display in using various filter. For Display the records SELECT statement ha sto write.

In Advance query I have learned about Joins,subquries and group by clause.

when using Joins there is 3 types of joins:
1.Inner Joins
2.Left Joins
3.Right Joins

Inner Joins are used to get the result from two tables which are joined and will only result which has commeom values
Left joins result common records and all records in left table even there is no match 
full join result will give all records of both tables even though they dont have commomn values

CHallenging part is learning joins as we need to understand which join can use in which scenario.
